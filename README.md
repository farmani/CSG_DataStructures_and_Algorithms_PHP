## Summary
- All in all, great book for starting with algorithms and data structures
- O(N) - constants are skipped, so even if we loop 10 times over an array, it is realistically O(10), but uses O(N) notation
- This way, we can make faster code without improving Big Oh (BubbleSort -> SelectionSort)
- Stacks and queues were introduced. Stack example was great - a very basic linting done via stacks. Queues had worse example
- First, sorts were reviewed to introduce these concepts. Done sorts are bubble, selection, insertion and quick
    - Note that quicksort is not O(log N) in space, it could fail on large numbers unless updated
- Then, hash tables were introduced. In JS, this is very obvious, as every object is basically a hash table
- Recursion showed quick sort and memoization (passing object with previous results down the line)
- Then, node based data structures came
- Node based data structures showed linked lists, which are great data structure for insertion/deletion at the end/start. They are great for queues for example
- Then, Binary Search Trees were shown. These are great if we can afford to keep our numbers sorted from start
- Heaps showed that we can work with an array as we would with a tree, but it has to be specific
    - Heaps must be a complete tree, and complete tree can be rewritten into an array
    - This allows us to be very fast
- Then, tries were shown. Yet another tree, but with multiple children. Autocomplete and autocorrect was done here
- Graphs showed that they are a superset of trees - all trees are graphs, but not all graphs are trees
- Graphs focus on relationship between data
- We've looked at weighted and unweighted graphs
    - Unweighted - followers on twitter, friends on facebook. How are data related to one another. Followers were directed (one way), friends were undirected (2-way)
    - Weighted were a different view - we added values to edges. Basically, this allowed us to create a simple algorithm for calculating plane prices between cities
- As part of graphs, we looked at interesting algorithms for traversing/finding closest node/pathfinding
    - Breadth-first search, depth-first search (Unweighted graphs)
    - Dijkstra (Weighted)
- Small chapter on space constraints was also part of this book. Here, we learned what space constraints are and how to deal with them
- Lastly, there were some techniques for code optimization. Basically showed various tasks that at first glance can be achieved in slow time, but they could be improved by
    - Finding patterns
    - Using different data structure
    - Find better algorithm

## To be done as a result of reading this book
- Implement own queue using doubly linked list, rather than currently implemented array
- Use such queue in BFS
- Review BFS/DFS/Dijkstra
- Apply in AoC2021 task
